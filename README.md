## ðŸ“Œ Overview

- **Meta-Llama-3-8B-Instruct** is part of Metaâ€™s Llama 3 model family, an **8-billion parameter instruction-tuned model**.
- Optimized for **chat and assistant-style interactions**, with strong reasoning and coding abilities.

- Trained on **~15 trillion tokens** of publicly available data and fine-tuned using **supervised fine-tuning (SFT)** and **reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)**.
- Input: **text only** â†’ Output: **text/code**.

---
- Built on an **autoregressive, decoder-only transformer** with **Grouped-Query Attention (GQA)** for faster inference.

Autoregressive - means the model predicts the next token (word or piece of a word) one at a time, based on the tokens it has already seen.
A decoder-only model skips the encoder and uses just the decoder portion. Itâ€™s suitable for tasks like text generation, where you're feeding in a prompt and asking the model to continue it.
GQA Grouped-Query Attention
In GQA, the model groups multiple queries to share the same key-value projections, which reduces computation and memory use.

## ðŸš€ Key Capabilities

### âœ… Instruction Following & Chat
- Excels at **following directions** and handling **conversational tasks**.

### ðŸ“– Extended Context
- Supports up to **8,192 tokens** for longer conversations and documents.

### ðŸ”’ Performance & Safety
- Instruction-tuning + RLHF ensure **helpfulness, alignment, and reduced harmful outputs**.

### ðŸ§© Reasoning & Coding
- Strong at **logic, programming tasks, and problem-solving**.
